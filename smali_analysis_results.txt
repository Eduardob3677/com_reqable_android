Looks like you\'re using a Google API key but have configured the SDK for the Amazon app store.\nEither use an Amazon API key which should look like \'amzn_1a2b3c4d5e6f7h\' or configure the SDK to use Google.\nSee https://rev.cat/auth for more details.
Looks like you\'re using a legacy API key.\nThis is still supported, but it\'s recommended to migrate to using platform-specific API key, which should look like \'goog_1a2b3c4d5e6f7h\' or \'amzn_1a2b3c4d5e6f7h\'.\nSee https://rev.cat/auth for more details.
